# CrisisChain: Revolutionizing Humanitarian Aid on Hedera

## 🌍 The Problem

**Humanitarian aid distribution faces critical challenges:**

- 🚫 **Lack of transparency**: Donors can't verify if aid reaches beneficiaries
- 💸 **High overhead costs**: Up to 30% lost to administrative expenses
- 🐌 **Slow distribution**: Traditional banking takes days or weeks
- 🔒 **Privacy concerns**: Beneficiaries' identities often exposed
- 📊 **Poor accountability**: Difficult to track aid usage and impact

**Result**: $400+ billion in annual aid with questionable efficiency

## 💡 Our Solution: CrisisChain on Hedera

**CrisisChain** is a blockchain-based aid distribution platform that ensures **transparency**, **trust**, and **efficiency** in humanitarian aid delivery.

### Why Hedera?
